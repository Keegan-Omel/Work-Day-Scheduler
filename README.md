The following is a Work Day Scheduler. When opening the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. There are time-blocks for each hour of the working day where you can enter events and or reminders. Click the corresponding time-block save button and Events/reminders are saved to local storage. After page is refreshed the saved events persist.
